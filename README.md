## Description of content

This teaching package contains content for the course “Control Systems”, consisting of the following:
1. A set of Course Notes, based in MATLAB [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html).
2. A set of Virtual Labs, also based in MATLAB Live Scripts.
3. A Project, which is based in MATLAB Live Scripts and Simulink.

The content of this package is intended for undergraduate students with little to no experience with MATLAB. MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing platform developed by MathWorks. 

The intention of this package is to introduce students to the fundamentals of Control Systems in an interactive manner, providing both rigorous theoretical development, along with guided demonstration and emulated practical exercises. This is made possible by making use of MATLAB Live Scripts which incorporate formatted text, LaTeX equations, imagery, and interactive code blocks.

### Important points to take note
- The weekly Virtual Labs contain questions that are meant to be answered within a Learning Management System (LMS), which for the University of Cape Town is Amathuba (an LMS based on D2L Brightspace).
  
- The worked solutions for the Virtual Labs will be provide upon kind request.

- Every week there is an online quiz within the LMS, which is intended to gauge the students familiarity with the content from the previous week. While the quizzes are for marks, the students are allowed to attempt the quizzes any number of times and receive instant feedback about their incorrect answers. These quizzes can be provided upon kind request.

- The University of Cape Town has a Campus Wide License which enables all staff members, students, and visitors to use the full suite of MATLAB products. This allows for easy access to the tools to every students from everywhere in the world. Students can use MATLAB directly in the web browser with MATLAB Online which is connected to MATLAB Drive, which gives every students 20Gb of space in the cloud.

- Students are required to complete the [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) before engaging in the Course Notes and Virtual Labs.

## Instructions

The course content can be approached in one of two ways:
1. Click on the Open in [MATLAB Online button](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=jedekoru/Introduction-to-Programming-in-MATLAB&file=Week%200%20-%20Content%20and%20Instructions/Week_0_Contents_and_instructions.mlx) at the top of this readme file to access the content online in your web browser.
2. Download all files and access the MATLAB content from the desktop app.

### Live Scripts

The Course Notes Live Scripts are presented as an interactive textbook with numbered sections. 

Live Scripts are divided into sections and contain interactive Live Script controls which include buttons, checkboxes, sliders, and dropdown menus. Feel free to interact with these controls as well as typing in your own code snippets. You can run each section within a Live Script individually. 

The Live Scripts are intended to be executed in sections. This can be achieved by pressing the Run Section button within the MATLAB interface, or CNTRL/CMD+ENTER.
